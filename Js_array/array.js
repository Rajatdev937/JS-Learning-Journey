//In JavaScript, an array is an ordered list of values. 
// Each value, known as an element, is assigned a numeric position in the array called its index. 
// The indexing starts at 0, so the first element is at position 0, the second at position 1, and so on.
//Arrays can hold any type of data-such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays—making them a flexible and essential part of JavaScript programming.


//eg-
let arr=[2,3,4,5];
console.log(arr);

//heterogenous array : An array which contains diff typ datatype elements.

let array=[2,3.4,54,'a',true];
console.log(array);
